    <h2> Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      “There is an invisible line eighteen inches ahead of the front row in far too many classes at Brown:
      the instructor is on one side, the students on the other. Information flows from front to back,
      and rarely the other way. Both students and instructors must make a conscious effort to erase this line,
      for teaching and learning to be most effective “

    <h2> Diversity & Inclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Blueno Eats recognizes and actively supports the diversity of Brown University community members
      and considers an inclusive environment critical to serving the diverse perspectives of our website.
      We believe that differences of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, age, religion,
      and disability enrich and broaden the intellectual discourse and scope of creative practices within the community.
      We uphold as an essential value a supportive, open and tolerant environment in which users of Blueno Eats can explore and
      respectfully discuss the full range of human experience in their work including controversial or difficult subject matter.
